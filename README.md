# Vulnezer-Prioritization_of_vulnerabilities
Python program for prioritising vulnerabilities found using a framework that utilises CVSS, KEV, and EPSS. 
The program offers an improved approach compared to the classic CVSS.

Confirmed CVSS problems are:
• Duplication: Many vulnerabilities have identical CVSS ratings, limiting prioritisation precision.
• Inconsistency: Different platforms and versions of CVSS gave different severity ratings.
• Human factors: The CVSS rating is based on subjective interpretations by assessors, which leads to inconsistencies.
• Limited scope: CVSS does not reflect real-world exploit trends or attack likelihood.
